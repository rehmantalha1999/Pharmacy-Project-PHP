This is a web application built completely from scratch using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. Please click on this link to see the website.

Please click this link to visit the webiste - https://homepharma.herokuapp.com/

The purpose of the website is to allow a household to keep a log of all the medicines that are present at home. Their brand names, purposes and expiry dates, so
in future if needed those medicines can be utilized instead of buying new medicines from the pharmacy.
